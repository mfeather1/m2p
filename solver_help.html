<b>Cube Solver Help</b>
<br><br>
<p>To use the solver press the Random button and after a scrambled cube 
appears press Solve.
When the solution appears, press the Play button (right arrow) on the
control bar under the cube.</p>
<br><br>
<b>Entering Colors and Solving</b>
<br><br>
<p>To solve an actual scrambled cube press the Clear button and enter the
colors by first clicking on a color in the palette (six squares above
layout) then clicking on a square in the layout which changes it to the
selected color.
Press the Show button to update the cube on the right side of the screen 
to see that it matches.
<br><br>
Press the Solve button after you have colored the entire layout.
It will first verify that the cube is valid and if not it will give a message
indicating what the problem is.  
If you get an error, compare your cube to the one on the screen and find the
square(s) that do not match and fix them, then press Solve again.
Repeat until there are no more errors.
<br><br>
Once all the errors are fixed it will solve the cube and the green bar will
appear, press the second button from the right to show the solution one move at
a time.</p>
